## General description
REST is a system by which customers can reserve a table and order food in advance. Booking is available for customers anytime and anywhere. It is the most convenient and the easiest way of managing the reservations. Customers can book tables through the application or website. Restaurants will be notified about the reservations and the tables will be prepared previously. Customers are able to pay for food by app also and in case of repeating the same orders, they are able to re-order, also cancel the order. Administrators are responsible for adding restaurants and checking the history, user lists. They are able to enter orders and check them, and also block some users when it is needed. It helps to attract more customers to the restaurants.
